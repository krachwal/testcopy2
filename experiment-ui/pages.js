      <li>Question 2?</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <!-- Benefits -->
  <h2>Benefits as a result of participation:</h2>
  <p>
    There will be no direct benefit to you from this research (aside from the monetary compensation you will receive).
  </p>

  <!-- Confidentiality -->
  <h2>Confidentiality:</h2>
  <p>
    Your responses, after removal of any identifiable private information, could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies, or shared as part of publication of the research study without additional consent from you. Data will be shared such that it cannot, in any way, be traced back to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    In particular, data from this study will be submitted to the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NDA is a large database where deidentified study data from many National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) studies are stored and managed. Deidentified study data means that no personal information about you is included. Sharing deidentified study data helps researchers learn new and important things about mental health and substance use more quickly than before.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every researcher (and institutions to which they belong) who requests use of your deidentified study data must promise to keep your data safe and promise not to try to learn your identity. Sharing your study data does have some risks, although these risks are rare. Your study data could be accidentally shared with an unauthorized person who may attempt to learn your identity. The study researchers will make every attempt to protect your identity.
  </p>

  <!-- Compensation -->
  <h2>Compensation:</h2>
  <p>
    Participants will be compensated with total payment (base payment + bonus) of at least $ dollars per hour (or the relevant fraction for experiments that require less time).
